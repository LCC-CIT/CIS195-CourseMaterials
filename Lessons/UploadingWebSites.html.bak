You must use Secure FTP (sftp) to transfer your files from      your machine to the web server.<br>      <br>      Your user id follows the pattern: last name first initial last 3 digits of      your L Number. For a student named <u>A</u>lex <u>Jones</u>, with an L      Number of 00123<u>456</u>, their User ID would be: <b>jonesa456</b>.<br>      <br>      Your password is unique and will be provided to you by your instructor      during the second week of class. The server is running a version of Linux      as it's operating system ... so everything is case sensitive.</p>    <p>You can use any FTP client to upload your web site to citstudent. A good      one is <a href="https://filezilla-project.org">FileZilla</a> which is      free and runs on Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.</p>    <p><a href="https://wiki.filezilla-project.org/FileZilla_Client_Tutorial_%28en%29">Tutorial:
        How to use FileZilla</a></p>    <div> FileZilla Site Manager settings dialog</div>    <div> <img src="file:///Users/birdb/Projects/CIS195-CourseMaterials/Lessons/FileZillaSiteManager.png"        alt="settings in the site manager"        title="Site Manager Dialog"        style="width: 541px; height: 431px;">    </div>    <p>All web files should be placed in your public_html folder on citstudent.      Organize your files in a way that makes sense to you ... but organize them      in some way ... you'll generate lots of files in this class!<br>      <br>      For example, assume that Alex has a folder called tutorial1 in their      public_html folder and that their completed assignment is in a file called      mpl.html. To test this file in a browser I would use the following URL:      http://citstudent.lanecc.edu/~jonesa456/tutorial1/mpl.html<br>      <br>      If you forget your password, you can reset it by navigating to <a href="https://wiki.filezilla-project.org/FileZilla_Client_Tutorial_%28en%29">citstudent.lanecc.edu</a>,      selecting the Utilities link, selecting the Reset Forgotten Passwords link      and completing the form provided. The system will send you an email      message within 24 hours containing your new password.<br>      <br>      You can change your password, as long as you know it, by navigating to <a        href="https://wiki.filezilla-project.org/FileZilla_Client_Tutorial_%28en%29">citstudent.lanecc.edu</a>,      selecting the Utilities link, selecting the Change Passwords link and      completing the form provided.<br>      <br>      If you have any trouble accessing your account on the server, please send      me an email message with specific information about what you believe your      user id and password to be as well as the behavior you encounter when      trying to access the server.</p>  </body></html>
