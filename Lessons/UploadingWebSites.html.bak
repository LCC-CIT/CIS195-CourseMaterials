You must use Secure FTP (SFTP) to transfer your files from      your machine to the web server.<br>      <br>      Your user id follows the pattern: last name first initial last 3 digits of      your L Number. For a student named <u>A</u>lex <u>Jones</u>, with an L      Number of 00123<u>456</u>, their User ID would be: <b>jonesa456</b>.<br>      <br>      Your password is unique and will be provided to you by your instructor      during the second week of class. The server is running a version of Linux      as it's operating system ... so everything is case sensitive.</p>    <p>You can use any FTP client to upload your web site to citstudent. A good      one is <a href="https://filezilla-project.org">FileZilla</a> which is      free and runs on Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.</p>    <p><a href="https://wiki.filezilla-project.org/FileZilla_Client_Tutorial_%28en%29">Tutorial:
        How to use FileZilla</a></p>    <div> FileZilla Site Manager settings dialog</div>    <div> <img src="FileZillaSiteManager.png" alt="settings in the site manager"        title="Site Manager Dialog"        style="width: 541px; height: 431px;">    </div>    <p>All web files should be placed in your public_html folder on citstudent.      Organize your files in a way that makes sense to you ... but organize them      in some way ... you'll generate lots of files in this class!<br>      <br>      For example, assume that Alex has a folder called tutorial1 in their      public_html folder and that their completed assignment is in a file called      mpl.html. To test this file in a browser you would use the following URL,      http://citstudent.lanecc.edu/~jonesa456/tutorial1/mpl.html<br>      <br>      If you forget your password, you can reset it by navigating to <a href="http://citstudent.lanecc.edu"        title="LCC web server"        target="_blank">citstudent.lanecc.edu</a>,      selecting the Utilities link, <s>selecting the Reset Forgotten Passwords        link and completing the form provided. The system will send you an email        message within 24 hours containing your new password.</s> <i>Note: As        of 11/2/17, the "Reset Forgotten Passwords" link is disabled.</i><br>      <br>      If you have any trouble accessing your account on the server, please send      me a message with specific information about what you believe your user id      and password to be as well as the behavior you encounter when trying to      access the server.</p>  </body></html>
