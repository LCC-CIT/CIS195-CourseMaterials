    <h2>How to upload web sites to citstudent</h2>
    <p>Every student taking one of the web development courses in the
      CIT department has access to the web server managed by the
      department: citstudent. Starting this week, you will post your
      completed labs to your folder on this server. You must use Secure
      FTP (SFTP) to transfer your files from your machine to the web
      server.<br>
      <br>
      Your user id follows the pattern: last name first initial last 3
      digits of your L Number. For a student named <u>A</u>lex <u>Jones</u>,
      with an L Number of 00123<u>456</u>, their User ID would be: <b>jonesa456</b>.<br>
      <br>
      Your password is unique and will be provided to you by your
      instructor. The server is running a version of the Linux operating
      system ... so everything is case sensitive and paths must use
      forward slashes, / , and not contain any spaces.<br>
    </p>
    <p>You can use any FTP client to upload your web site to citstudent.
      A good one is <a href="https://filezilla-project.org">FileZilla</a>
      which is free and runs on Windows, Mac OS, and Linux. Here is the
      link for the <a
        href="https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?show_all=1">FileZilla


        Client download page</a>.</p>

    <p>All web files should be placed in your <code><font size="+1">public_html</font></code>
      folder on citstudent. Organize your files in a way that makes
      sense to you ... but organize them in some way ... you'll generate
      lots of files in this class!<br>
      <br>
      To determine the URL for your web page, compose the URL this way:
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><font size="+1"><code>https://citstudent.lanecc.edu/~</code></font></b><font
        size="+1"><code>your_user_name</code></font><b><font size="+1"><code>/</code></font></b><font
        size="+1"><code>directory_name</code></font><b><font size="+1"><code>/</code></font></b><font
        size="+1"><code>home_page_name.html</code></font><br>
      For example, assume that Alex has a folder called <code><font
          size="+1">lab1</font></code> in their <code><font size="+1">public_html
        </font></code>folder and that their completed assignment is in a
      file called <font size="+1"><code>alexbio.html</code></font>. To
      see this file in a browser you would use the following URL:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <code><font size="+1"><b></b></font></code><b><code><font
            size="+1">https://citstudent.lanecc.edu/~jonesa456/lab1/alexbio.html<br>
          </font></code></b>Or, if Alex's home page was named<code><font
          size="+1"> index.html</font></code> (with a lower case i) then
      the URL would be:<b><code><br>
        </code></b><b><code><b><code><font size="+1">&nbsp;
                https://citstudent.lanecc.edu/~jonesa456/lab1/</font></code></b></code></b></p>
    <p><b><code></code></b> If you have any trouble accessing your
      account on the server, please send your instructor a message with
      specific information about what you believe your user id and
      password to be as well as the behavior you encounter when trying
      to access the server.</p>
