<h1>Term Project Requirements</h1>

<h2>CIS195, Web Authoring</h2>

For your term project, you will create a website that can have any content you wish.  The project will be graded on the basis of technical merit (coding); however, I would encourage you to try to put some artistry into it as well.  Your project may be a portfolio item that you will want to show to potential future collaborators and employers.  

Your project must represent your individual work.  Other students will review your web site and give you suggestions, but you must be the one to make changes to the code. 

The project will be due the last week of the term. See the syllabus or Moodle for the due date. Also, note that this project is a significant part of your grade, so start early in the term and give yourself plenty of time so that you can do a great job on it.

The project must include the following:

  - The site must contain at least 5 pages and each page must have a distinct purpose.

  - Each page must have a header (which includes headings) that is consistent between pages.  The header should clearly identify the purpose of the site.  For example, if the site has a banner “Declawed”, it should have a smaller tagline reading, “A competition-free space for women to relate to one another” or “The ins and outs of keeping a large predator around little children” or “Low cost services for the family pet”.

  - Each page must have a footer that includes the author’s name, copyright, the date the page was last modified, and anything else pertinent to your site. The footers must be consistent between pages.

  - Each page must have a navigation bar that allows the user to directly go to each page.  The navigation bar must be consistent between pages.  

  - Each page must have at least one paragraph of meaningful text or a table.

  - All pages must use the same CSS file, but you can have other CSS files that are only used on certain pages, as long as the overall user experience is consistent between pages.  

  - At least one page must have an embedded style in the head element.

  - The website must include at least 3 figures (containing images) in addition to any images contained in the header, footer or navigation bar of the page. 

  - All images must have meaningful alt text for users with low vision.

  - At least one of the pages must contain a table with at least two columns and at least two rows.  The table must contain column headings.

  - Each page should include section, article, and header semantic elements.
