# Lab 8 Instructions

## Multimedia

#### Objectives

You will create a page containing the following HTML elements:

- `<audio>`

- `<object>`

- `<iframe>`

## Requirements

Create a web page that uses each of the three elements listed above. You can make a new page, or add these elements to one your existing pages.

## Implementation

- Examples of content for each multimedia type:

  - Audio: a sound file you put in your web site folder. It could be mp3 or another audio format.

  - Object: this is intended to be used for things that depend on browser extensions in order to be seen or heard. Most of it's former uses have been deprecated, but a good use for it now would be for displaying non-html documents, like PDFs.
  - Iframe: embed some HTML page that is in a file in the folder for your own web site.

- You can use multimedia files you created yourself or that are legal to download and use for academic (non-commercial) web sites. Here are some places to find these:

  -  [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/): public domain photos, images, and videos.

  - [Freesound](https://freesound.org/browse/): a huge database of hundreds of thousands of sounds: birdsong, thunderstorms, voice snippets, etc. 

  - [Open Music Archive](http://www.openmusicarchive.org/): out-of-copyright sound recordings including instrumental, 1920s, blues, weird, solo, work, country, dance lessons, and remix.
