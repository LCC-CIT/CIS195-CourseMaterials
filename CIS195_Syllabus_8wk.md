# Course Description

This four-credit course provides students who have minimal computer experience with the concepts and skills necessary to create static web pages using HyperText Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).  Through hands-on practice students will master the concepts, tools and skills needed to construct web pages and to upload pages to a web server on the internet.

The intention of the course is to enable you to create and maintain static pages that could be part of any modern web site using current technologies and tools.

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Code Editors - for creating HTML and CSS files (like Visual Studio Code)
- FTP clients - for uploading files to a server (like FileZilla)

## Effort

Since this is a compressed eight-week, four-credit class; students should plan to devote at least 14 hours per week to the class.

- 4 hours for class participation (in person, live on Zoom, or Zoom recordings)
- 3 hours for reading and studying (tutorials and lecture notes).
- 7 hours for lab assignments.

## Themes

In addition to the topics listed in the [course schedule](#course-schedule), these themes will be interwoven with those topics:

- How the Internet works (HTTP Protocol)
- Web page loading speed (performance)
- Browser compatibility
- Ethics and internet privacy
- Internet security

## Skills

- Understand and be able to explain the history of the World Wide Web and HTML.

- Effectively use: structural  and semantic HTML elements, anchor tags, relative and absolute links, e-mail links, tables, horizontal rules, image tags, background images, image hyperlinks, forms and input elements, element groups, and custom buttons.

- Use cascading style sheets(CSS) to format common page and text properties as well as for layout and positioning of elements on a web page.

- Use an HTML and a CSS validators to ensure the correctness of web pages.

- Use an FTP client to upload and manage files on a web server.

- Discuss concepts, themes and issues orally and in writing.

- Evaluate your own web site implementation work.  Evaluate the web site implementation work of other students and provide constructive feedback orally and in writing.

- Respond appropriately to and assimilate feedback provided by other students and your instructor.

  

# Learning Resources

## Textbook

There is no textbook for this class. You will learn from the class lectures, lecture notes, and online tutorials. 

## Computer Lab and In-Person Tutoring

The CIT computer lab in building19, room 135, is equipped with computers and and all the software required for this course.  The lab is available to all students in the CIT department. There are tutors available in the lab to help you with your lab assignments. A schedule will be posted on the large white board inside the lab with a list of the tutors and the times they will be available.

## Online Tutoring and Support Services

In addition to the tutors available in the CIT computer lab, there is tutoring available online. You can connect with tutors, get technical support from the Student Help Desk (SHeD), and learn more about Career Pathways/STEP programs in the [Lane Support Hub](http://lanecc.edu/hub) (Zoom link: [lanecc.edu/hub]()). Feel free to drop in or guarantee time with a tutor by making an appointment using [WCOnline](https://lanecc.mywconline.com/). Check out the [ATS website](https://www.lanecc.edu/get-support/academic-support/academic-and-tutoring-services) for updated hours and additional information.

## Software

If you plan to do lab work somewhere other than in the classroom or the CIT Computer Lab, you will need: 

- "Office" software for Word processing, spreadsheets, slides, etc., such as:

  -  [MS Office](https://lanecc.helpjuice.com/student-faqs/microsoft-office-365-for-lcc-students-staff)&mdash;Free for LCC students. Runs on Mac OS and Windows. Use this link to get it. 
    
     *About Microsoft accounts: You may have both a [school account](https://myaccount.microsoft.com) and a [personal account](https://account.microsoft.com). Use your Microsoft <u>school account</u> to get MS Office.*
     
  - [LibreOffice](http://www.libreoffice.org)&mdash; Free, open source, cross-platform (Mac, Windows, Linux) software.

  - [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com)&mdash;Free to use online with your LCC gmail account.

- A code (text) editor to create your web pages.  [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is a free code editor that can be downloaded via the internet and used on Windows, Mac OS or Linux. Alternatively, you can use TextWrangler on Mac OS, or Notepad++ on Windows.

- Software that can be used to manipulate images such as the <u>Windows Paint</u> program (included in Windows). Mac users can use the <u>Preview</u> app (included in MacOS), but it just barely meets the needs of this class. 

  Most other full-featured image editing apps such as Adobe Photoshop (not free), or [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) (a free, cross-platform, app similar to Photoshop) will also meet the needs of this class. The two main things you'll need to do are: change the size of images and find pixel coordinates in images.

- At least two modern browsers to view/test your web pages.  The latest versions of [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), and [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) can be downloaded for free.  Many other browsers like Safari and Edge, are also suitable for your use in this class.

- An ftp client to upload your web pages to citstudent.lanecc.edu. [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?show_all=1) is a good free option that runs on Windows, Mac OS, or Linux.

## Web Resources

- https://classes.lanecc.edu (Moodle) is the Learning Management System for this course.  All course materials and activities will be managed through Moodle.
- https://citstudent.lanecc.edu will be used to host student web sites. You will be provided with the login information you need to upload your pages to this server.

## Weekly Learning Cycle

| Monday                                                       | Tuesday                                            | Wednesday                         | Thursday                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Start the assigned reading.<br /><br />Take the reading quiz any time before Thursday's class. | Participate in class or watch the video recording. | Start this week's lab assignment. | Reading quiz closes before class.<br /><br />Participate in class  or watch the video recording.<br /><br />Submit last week's lab assignment. |

### Reading Quizzes
Weekly quizzes are given that cover the required reading for that week. These quizzes must be taken before the first class meeting of the week. They are "open book" (you can look at whatever reading material was assigned.)

### Midterm and Final Quizzes

The midterm and final quizzes are given in weeks 5 and 8. See the [course schedule](#course-schedule) for exact dates and times. 

These quizzes will need to given in the testing center on the third floor of the Center Building, room 311. See the [Instructional Testing Services](https://www.lanecc.edu/get-support/academic-support/instructional-testing-services) web site for testing times and procedures. Students are allowed to prepare a 4 X 6 card with notes to use during the quiz.

For students who live outside Lane county, please send an email to [online@lanecc.edu](mailto:online@lanecc.edu) as soon as possible to arrange for your midterm and final to be proctored at a location near you.

## Academic Honesty

While students are encouraged to discuss labs and to use each other as resources, each student is responsible for his/her own work. In other words, you can help each other, but you can't copy any part of someone else's work. The end product must be each student's own individual work.

## Attendance and Participation

Attendance (in person, via Zoo, or by watching recordings), participation in class discussions and exercises, and making posts in the Moodle forums are aspects of participation that will be assessed by the instructor.

Students who participate via Zoom can join the class discussion through the Zoom chat dialog box, or by turning on their microphones to ask and answer questions.

Students who aren't able to participate during class time, but instead watch the recordings, can ask and answer questions in the Moodle Q & A forum.

**No-Show Drop:** LCC has a [no-show drop](https://www.lanecc.edu/esfs/noshow-drops) policy. which means that during the first week of the term, to avoid being dropped, a student must:

- Attend at least one class in person 

  Or

- Attend at least one Zoom class session with your webcam on

  Or

- Complete one quiz or assignment
