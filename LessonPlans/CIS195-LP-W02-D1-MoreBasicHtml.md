## History of the World Wide Web

[Wikipedia: History of HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)

### Tim Berners-Lee

The World Wide Web was invented by the British computer scientist [Tim Berners-Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee), who was a researcher at CERN in Switzerlaned in the 1980 and 90s.

- He wrote a proposal to create the WWW by combining the Internet, which was new and evolving, with Hypertext.
  - The web is not the same as the internet--the internet consistes of other services as well.
  - The proposal was submitted March 12, 1989--considered the birthday of the web.
- The first web site went online in 1991.
- He founded the [W3C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium) and is it's current director.
- Originally used by scientists to share research papers.

The first web browser available on PC and Mac was Mosaic, developed by Marc Andreessen's team at the NCSA and released in 1993

### The web at 30

The original idea was to make it easy for scientists, and then later, for everyone to freely share information and ideas.
How is this working out now? 
What is the effect of:

- Commercialization
- Search engines and the way they prioritize searches
  - Originally the links people saw were on pages created by friends, colleages or other trusted sources, so they were relevant and the quality was high.
- Social media
- Personal information stored "in the cloud"

What can we as web authors, designers, developers do to make the web better?

## Visual Studio Code

How to download, install and use VS Code

## In-line and Block Elements

**In-line elements** arrange themselves horizontally on the page. Examples are:

- <em>
- <strong>
- <img>

**Block elements** arrange themselves vertically on the page. Examples are:

- headings (<h1>, <h2>, etc.)

- paragraph: <p>

- lists: <ul> and <ol>

  

## More HTML Elements 

### Nested lists

Lists can be placed within lists. The right way to do it is to put the nested list inside a li element of the parent list. For example:

```
<ul>
   <li>Deserts
     <ul>
         <li>Pie</li>
         <li>Cake</li>
        <li>Ice Cream</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
    <li>The rest of the list</li>
</ul>
```

This would look like this:

- Deserts
  - Pie
  - Cake
  - Ice Cream
- The rest of the list



###Figures

Figures are used to change images from inline to block elements. They also allow you to add a caption to the image.

```
<figure>
<img
src="https://developer.mozilla.org/static/img/favicon144.png"
alt="The beautiful MDN logo.">
<figcaption>MDN Logo</figcaption>
</figure>
```

### Block quotes

The block quote element indents the text and puts blank lines above and below it:  <blockquote>

###Special characters

For example, the copyright symbol: Â©

```
&copy; or &#169;
```
