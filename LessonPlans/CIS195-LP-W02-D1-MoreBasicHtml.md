## In-line and Block Elements

**In-line elements** arrange themselves horizontally on the page. Examples are:

- <em>
- <strong>
- <img>

**Block elements** arrange themselves vertically on the page. Examples are:

- headings (<h1>, <h2>, etc.)

- paragraph: <p>

- lists: <ul> and <ol>

  

## More HTML Elements 

### Nested lists

Lists can be placed within lists. The right way to do it is to put the nested list inside a li element of the parent list. For example:

```
<ul>
   <li>Deserts
     <ul>
         <li>Pie</li>
         <li>Cake</li>
        <li>Ice Cream</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
    <li>The rest of the list</li>
</ul>
```

This would look like this:

- Deserts
  - Pie
  - Cake
  - Ice Cream
- The rest of the list



###Figures

Figures are used to change images from inline to block elements. They also allow you to add a caption to the image.

```
<figure>
<img
src="https://developer.mozilla.org/static/img/favicon144.png"
alt="The beautiful MDN logo.">
<figcaption>MDN Logo</figcaption>
</figure>
```

### Block quotes

The block quote element indents the text and puts blank lines above and below it:  <blockquote>

###Special characters

For example, the copyright symbol: Â©

```
&copy; or &#169;
```
