[Wikipedia: History of HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)

### Tim Berners-Lee

The World Wide Web was invented by the British computer scientist [Tim Berners-Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee), who was a researcher at CERN in Switzerlaned in the 1980 and 90s.

- He wrote a proposal to create the WWW by combining the Internet, which was new and evolving, with Hypertext.
  - The web is not the same as the internet--the internet consistes of other services as well.
  - The proposal was submitted March 12, 1989--considered the birthday of the web.
- The first web site went online in 1991.
- He founded the [W3C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium) and is it's current director.
- Originally used by scientists to share research papers.

The first web browser available on PC and Mac was Mosaic, developed by Marc Andreessen's team at the NCSA and released in 1993

### The web at 30

The original idea was to make it easy for scientists, and then later, for everyone to freely share information and ideas.
How is this working out now? 
What is the effect of:

- Commercialization
- Search engines and the way they prioritize searches
  - Originally the links people saw were on pages created by friends, colleages or other trusted sources, so they were relevant and the quality was high.
- Social media
- Personal information stored "in the cloud"

What can we as web authors, designers, developers do to make the web better?
