## Web Sites, HTML and CSS

- Why we make web sites.
  - What are some reasons you might want to make a web site?
- HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)
  - It provides a way to structure the content of pages.
  - It lets us link pages together.
  - A markup language is different from a programming language.
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
  - Provides formatting and styling for the HTML pages.
- Full blown example: [Chennai web page](https://lcc-cit.github.io/CIS195-Demos/Unit02\SouthIndia\Chennai)

  - View the source to see what the HTML looks like.
  - You will be able to make a site like this by the middle of the term.
