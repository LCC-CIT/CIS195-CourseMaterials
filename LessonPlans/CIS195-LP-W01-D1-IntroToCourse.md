  - What are some reasons you might want to make a web site?
- HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)
  - It provides a way to structure the content of pages.
  - It lets us link pages together.
  - A markup language is different from a programming language.
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
  - Provides formatting and styling for the HTML pages.
- Full blown example: [Chennai web page](https://lcc-cit.github.io/CIS195-Demos/Unit02/SouthIndia/Chennai)

  - View the source to see what the HTML looks like.
  - You will be able to make a site like this by the middle of the term.

### Discussion

  - View the source to see what the HTML looks like.

    This is the stuff you need in every web page!


- When you make a web page, you need to define html, head and body elements.
  
- Explain the syntax of HTML
  - tags
  - elements
  - hierarchy

#### Adding some content and structure to the skeleton

Now we're going to modify the empty page to make our own first web page. You can use Notepad on Windows, or TextEdit[^1] on a Mac.

 on a Mac.
