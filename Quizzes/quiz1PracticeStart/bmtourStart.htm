Bike the Mountains Tour

The Bike the Mountains Tour rises from the town of Littleton, 
Colorado and explores the Colorado Front Range. Our tour 
crosses the Continental Divide twice, giving you the 
opportunity to bike the highest paved roads in the 
United States. This tour is a classic showcase of Colorado's 
Rocky Mountain scenery.

The Bike the Mountains Tour is amazing. I highly 
recommend it and would gladly return.

Not designed for the weekend cyclist, this tour is offered 
only for those fit enough to ride high mountain passes. We 
provide sag wagons and support. Your lodging and meals are 
also part of the registration fee.
We guarantee tough climbs, amazing sights, sweaty jerseys, 
and lots of fun.

This is the seventh year we've offered the Bike the Mountains 
Tour. It is our most popular tour and riders are returning 
again and again. Our experienced tour leaders will be there 
to guide, help, encourage, draft, and lead you
every stroke of the way. Come join us!
