## Introduction

This week is your opportunity to review all that we've covered in the first four weeks of class&mdash;both as preparation for the midterm quiz as well as a way to firm up what you've learned about HTML and CSS so far.

Focus on understanding concepts&mdash;not on memorizing answers. The only thing to memorize is some terminology and syntax (Some HTML element names and attributes, and CSS properties). The rest of what you need to know is how HTML and CSS work and how to write code.



## About the Quiz

- The quiz will cover material in the lecture notes from the first four weeks of the term.
- When and where to take the quiz:
  - In the classroom at the normal class time.
  - In the Instructional Testing Center between 9:00 am and 7:00 pm on Wednesday or Thursday.
    - Bring ID.
- For both locations:
  - You will have 1 hour and 50 minutes to finish the quiz.
  - You can bring a 4 X 6 note card.
  - You are not allowed to search the internet for answers, use AI (like chatGPT) or get help from another person.




## What to Review

### Lecture notes

Review all the lecture notes and example code for the class, starting at week 1. If there is anything you are unsure about, copy the example code into VS Code and experiment with it. Modifying code to see what happens a great way to learn!

A good way to get a quick overview of what we covered is to look at the review section on each of the lecture notes.

### Example code

Download the instructor's examples and play with the code. Modify the code and experiment.

### Lab assignments

Review the code you wrote for the lab assignments. Make sure you understand how everything works. If there are things you don't understand, look for answers in the lecture notes and readings and post questions in the Moodle Q and A forum.

### Practice Quiz

There is a practice quiz available on Moodle that has the same style questions and covers the same concepts as the real quiz but using different questions. As you take the practice quiz, focus on understanding concepts, not on memorizing answers.

In order to do well on the midterm quiz and on the homework for the second half of the term, you need to understand the underlying concepts behind the questions and programming problems--not just "the answers".
