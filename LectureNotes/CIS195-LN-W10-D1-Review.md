This week is your opportunity to review all that we've covered in this class&mdash;both as preparation for the final quiz as well as a way to firm up your knowledge of HTML and CSS so you will be ready to write great web developer in the future!

## Review Process

### On your own

**Lecture notes**
Review all the lecture notes and example code for the class, starting at week 1. If there is anything you are unsure about, copy the example into Visual Studio Code. Modifying code and experiement with it. Modifying code to see what happens a great way to learn!

**Example apps**

Download the example apps and play with the code. Think of how you might want to change the web page, then modify the HTML and/or CSS see if it worked the way you thought it would. Modify the code and experiment.

**Lab assignments**

Review the code you wrote for the lab assignments. Make sure you understand how everything works. If there are things you don't understand, look for answers in the class readings, lecture notes, or on the web and post questions in the Q and A forum.

### Together in Class

In class this week, I will go over topics that students have found challenging and give you time to work on lab assignments, review, and ask questions in class.
