**CIS 195, Web Authoring 1: HTML**

#Lab 3 Instructions



## Part 1: A web page with internal links

Create a single web page that gives a short catalog of information. An example is the page I wrote in class on the planets in our solar system. The page should have a list of items at the top with internal links to sections on the same page containing information related to each item. The page should use each of the following HTML elements:

- A `<nav>` element containing a list of links. 

  It doesn't have to be an actual `<uo>` or `<ol>` element, it could be a series of links with `<br>` tags after each one so they are arranged vertically.

- Hyperlink, `<a>`, elements with *href*  attributes that link to *id* attributes in elements on the same page.

- Image links. These are just hyperlinks with images inside instead of text.

- A hyperlink to an e-mail address.



## Part 2: A web page with an image map

Choose a picture that has at least eight items or eight sections in it.  

- Create hot-spots for each of the items or sections in the picture. 
- Use each of the hot-spot shapes at least once.
- Each hot-spot should link to another page.
- The linked pages should all be in a single sub-folder.
- At least one of the links should go to an id on an element in another page.
- Use the `<base>`Â elsement to specify the sub-folder that contains the linked pages.

Check your pages using the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org)
