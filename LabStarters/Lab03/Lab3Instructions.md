**CIS 195, Web Authoring 1: HTML**

#Lab 3 Instructions



## Part 1: A web page with internal links

Create a single web page that gives a short list of information. An example is the page I wrote in class on the planets in our solar system. The page should have a list of items at the top with internal links to sections on the same page containing information related to each item. The page should use each of the following HTML elements:

- A `<nav>` element that will contain a list of links. 

  (The "list" doesn't have to be an actual `<uo>` or `<ol>` list element, it could be a series of links with `<br>` tags after each one so they are arranged vertically.)

- Hyperlink, `<a>`, elements with *href* attributes that link to *id* attributes in elements on the same page--at least four.

- An Image link. This is just ahyperlink with an image inside instead of text.

- A hyperlink to an e-mail address.



## Part 2: A web page with an image map

Create another web page which contains a picture (of your choice) that has at least three regions that are appropriate for hot-spots.  

- Create hot-spots for each of the regions in the picture. 
- Use each of the three hot-spot shapes (rect, circle and poly) at least once.
- Each hot-spot should link to another page.
- The linked pages should all be in a single sub-folder. There should be at least three linked pages in the folder.
- At least one of the links should go to an internal location in another page ( a link to an id).
- Use the `<base>` elsement to specify the sub-folder that contains the linked pages.

Check your pages using the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org)
