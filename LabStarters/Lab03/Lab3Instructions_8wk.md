**CIS 195, Web Authoring 1: HTML**

# Lab 3 Instructions



## Part 1: A web page with internal links

Create a single web page that contains short sections of information on some topic. The page should have a set of links at the top of the page that take a user to those sections on the same page. The page should use each of the following HTML elements:

- A `<nav>` element that will contain a set of links. 

  (The set of links doesn't have to be in an `<uo>` or `<ol>` list element, it could be a series of links with `<br>` tags after each one so they are arranged vertically on the page.)

- Hyperlink, `<a>`, elements with *href* attributes that link to *id* attributes in elements on the same page--at least four.

- An Image link. This is just a hyperlink with an image inside instead of text.

- A hyperlink to an e-mail address.



## Part 2: Restrutured Review Site.

You will restructure your review site from the previous lab so that each review page and its images are in their own directory (folder). You will also add a set of navigation links, in a `nav` element, to each web page .

Check your pages using the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org)  

## Submission

#### Publishing to citstudent

- Use FileZilla to upload the folders containing your web sites to citstudent.
  - Create a lab3 folder with two sub-folders, one for part 1 and one for part 2. Name them to reflect the content of your web page and web site.
- Record the URL (web addresses) of your two home pages so that you can enter them on Moodle.

#### Tips

- Remember that *public_html* is <u>not</u> part of the URL.
- Don't put spaces or punctuation in the directory or file names.
- The casing (upper vs. lower case) of directory and file names must match the `src`and `href` attributes in your web pages.
- Do not zip the files.

### Submitting your web sites to Moodle

1. Zip the files for part 1.
2. Zip the files for part 2.
3. Upload both zip files to Moodle using the lab submission link.
4. Enter the URLs of the two home pages in the text area of the Moodle submission page.
