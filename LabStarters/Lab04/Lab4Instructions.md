# Lab 4 Instructions

## Using CSS to Format Web Pages

You will practice using CSS by applying it to the web sites you made in lab 2.

### Part 1

You will use the web page from part 1 of lab 2 (it was one of your three review pages) as your starting point. 

1. Create an *external style sheet* (.css file) with the following types of rules:
   - A rule that uses a single HTML element as a selector.
   - A rule that uses multiple HTML elements as selectors.
   - A rule that uses an id as a selector.
   - A rule that uses a class as a selector.
2. Link the CSS file to the HTML page.
   - Each style rule should affect at least one element on the HTML page.
3. Add at least one *embedded style* to the HTML page.
4. Use at least one *in-line style* on the HTML page.

### Part 2

Use part 2 of lab 2 as a starting point. (It was a review site with a home page and at least three review pages.)

1. Create a *external style sheet* (.css file) with:
   - At least eight rules.
   - At least four different kinds of selectors (element, class, id, contextual, etc.).
   - At least four different property types.
2. Link the external style sheet to every HTML page in your site.
   - Each HTML page should be affected by at least one of the style rules in the external style sheet.
3. Add at least one *embedded style* to at least four of your pages.
4. Use at least one *in-line style* in at least four of your pages.

Check your pages using the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org)  and the [W3C CSS Validator](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).



## Submitting your web sites to Moodle

- Zip the files in part 2 (which incudes the page in part 1)

- Upload the zip file to Moodle using the lab submission link.
