#Lab 4 Instructions


##Using CSS to Format Web Pages

You will practice using CSS by applying it to the web sites you made in lab 2.

###Part 1

You will use the web page from lab 2, part 1 as your starting point. 

1. Create an external CSS file with the following types of rules:
   - A rule that uses a single HTML element as a selector.
   - A rule that uses multiple HTML elements as selectors.
   - A rule that uses an id as a selector.
   - A rule that uses a class as a selector.

2. Link the CSS file to the HTML page.
3. Apply each of the style rules in at least one place on the page.
4. Add at least one embedded style to the HTML page.
5. Use at least on in-line style on the HTML page.

###Part 2

Use lab 2, part 2 as a starting point. (It was a review site with a home page and at least three review pages.)

1. Create a external style sheet (.css file) with:
   - At least eight rules.
   - At least four different kinds of selectors (element, class, id, contextual, etc.).
   - At least eight different property types.

2. Link the external style sheet to every HTML page in your site.
3. Each page should be affected by at least one of the style rules in the external style sheet.
4. Add at least one embedded style to at least four of your pages.
5. Use at least one in-line style in at least four of your pages.

Check your pages using the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org)  and the [W3C CSS Validator](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).
