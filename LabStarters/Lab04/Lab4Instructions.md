# Lab 4 Instructions

## Using CSS to Format Web Pages

In this lab assignment you will practice using what you learned about CSS this week by applying it to the web site you made for lab 2.

### Part 1: A style sheet for a single page

You will add CSS to the one HTML page in your review site that you made for part 1 of lab 2.

1. Create an *external style sheet* (.css file) with the following types of rules:
   
   (Be sure that each style rule affects at least one element on the page.)
   
   - A rule that uses a single HTML element as a selector.
   - A rule that uses multiple HTML elements as selectors.
   - A rule that uses an id as a selector.
   - A rule that uses a class as a selector.
   
2. Link the CSS file to the HTML page.
   
3. Add at least one *embedded style* to the HTML page.

4. Add at least one *in-line style* in the HTML page.

### Part 2: A style sheet for the whole web site.

You will create a second style sheet that you will apply to the whole web site, including the page from part 1, that now already has a style sheet.

1. Create a *external style sheet* (.css file) with:
   - At least eight <u>rules</u>.
   - At least four different <u>types</u> of selectors (element, class, id, contextual, etc.).
   - At least four different <u>property types</u> (color, font-face, text-align, etc.) across all the rules.
2. Link the external style sheet to every HTML page in your site.
   - Each HTML page should be affected by at least one of the style rules in the external style sheet.
   - The review page above, will now have two style sheets linked to it. If there are rules in both style sheets with the same selectors and those rules have one or more of the same properties, the ones in the style sheet linked last (lowest) on the HTML page will take precedence.

Check your pages using the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org)  and the [W3C CSS Validator](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).



## Submitting your web sites to Moodle

- Zip the files from part 2 (which includes those from part 1) into a single zip file.
