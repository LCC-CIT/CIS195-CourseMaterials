# Lab 4 Instructions

## Using CSS to Format Web Pages

In this lab assignment you will practice using what you learned about CSS this week by applying it to the web site you made for lab 2.

### Part 1: A style sheet for a single page

You will add CSS to the HTML home page for the review site that you made for labs 2 and 3.

1. Create an *embedded style* (`style` element inside the `head`) with at least 3 different rules.  
  (These should be different from the rules you put in the external style sheet (part 2) and affect at least one element on the page.)
   1. Add at least one *in-line style* (`style` attribute) in an element on the page.
  

### Part 2: A style sheet for the whole web site.

You will create a second style sheet that you will apply to the whole web site, including the home page that already has a style sheet.

1. Create a *external style sheet* (.css file) with:
   - At least eight <u>rules</u>.
   - At least four different <u>types</u> of selectors including:
     - A single HTML element as a selector.
     - Multiple HTML elements as selectors.
     - An id as a selector.
     - A class as a selector.
   - At least four different <u>property types</u> (color, font-face, text-align, etc.) across all the rules.
2. Link the external style sheet to every HTML page in your site.
   - Each HTML page should be affected by at least one of the style rules in the external style sheet.

Note: The home page will now have two style sheets (an embedded one and an external one). If there are rules in both style sheets with the same selectors and those rules have one or more of the same properties, the ones in the embedded style sheet will take precedence.

Check your pages using the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org)  and the [W3C CSS Validator](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).



## Submitting your web sites

### Uploading to Moodle

- Zip the files from part 2 (which includes those from part 1) into a single zip file.

- Upload the zip file to Moodle using the lab submission link.

### Publishing to citstudent

- Use FileZilla to upload the folders containing your web sites to citstudent.
  - Create a lab3 folder with two sub-folders, one for part 1 and one for part 2. Name them to reflect the content of your web page and web site.
- Record the URL (web addresses) of your two home pages so that you can enter them on Moodle.
