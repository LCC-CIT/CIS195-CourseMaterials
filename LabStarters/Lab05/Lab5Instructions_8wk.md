# Lab 5 Instructions


## Using CSS to Control Web Page Layout

You will practice using CSS by applying it to the review web site from your previous lab assignment.

### Part 1

Modify the home page of your review web site from the previous lab assignment. Add rules to the style sheet for the site to:

1. Set a fixed width for the body of the page.

2. Make the navigation links look like buttons by giving them:

- A background color.
- A border.
- Appropriate margin and padding.
- Rounded corners.

- Use the float property to align the navigation links horizontally.
- Use the clear property to end the float.

**Note:** Please use a different HTML structure for your navigation menu than I did in my [South India web site](https://lcc-cit.github.io/CIS195-Demos/Unit05/Finished/). For example, you could put your links inside`<p>` elements instead of a `ul` with `li` elements.


### Part 2

1. Modify navigation links on each page to look like the one on your home page.
2. Add styling for the figures on each page:
   - Add padding, a visible border, and margin.
   - Make the corners of the figure rounded.
3. Add an aside to at least one of the review pages.
   - Float it to the right.
   - Clear the float.



**Notes**

- Use my South India website as a guide, but please don't copy and paste the HTML or CSS and then just put your content into my code.
- Check your pages using the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org)  and the [W3C CSS Validator](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).



## Submission

#### Publishing to citstudent

- Use FileZilla to upload the folders containing your web site to citstudent.
  - Do <u>not</u> zip the files.
  - Since both parts 1 and 2 are in the same web site, you can just upload that one web site.
- Record the URL (web address) of your home page so that you can enter it in the text area on Moodle.
  Hint: remember that *public_html* is <u>not</u> part of the URL.

#### Submitting to Moodle

- Zip the web site (both parts 1 and 2 are in one web site).

- Upload the zip file to Moodle.

- Enter the URL (web address) of your site's home page in the "Online Text" box for this assignment on  Moodle. This is important; without this, I won't be able to find your web page on the internet.
