#Lab 5 Instructions


##Using CSS to Control Web Page Layout

You will practice using CSS by applying it to the web sites you made in lab 2.

###Part 1

You will use the web page from lab 4, part 1 (originally done for lab 2, part 1) as your starting point. 

1. Create a external CSS file with the rules that:
   - Set a background image.
   - Set a fixed width for the body of the page.
   - Use the float property to move the figure to the right side of the page
   - Use the clear property to end the float.


###Part 2

Use lab 4, part 2 as a starting point. (Originally done for lab 2, part 2. It was a review site with a home page and at least three review pages.)

*Instructions for this part will be ready before Thursday's class.*
Check your pages using the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org)  and the [W3C CSS Validator](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).



##Submitting your web sites to Moodle

- Zip the files in part 1

- Zip the files in part 2

- Upload both zip files to Moodle using the lab submission link.
