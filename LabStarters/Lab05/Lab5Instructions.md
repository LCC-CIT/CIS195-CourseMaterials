# Lab 5 Instructions


## Using CSS to Control Web Page Layout

You will practice using CSS by applying it to the web sites you made in lab 4.

### Part 1

You will use the web page from lab 4, part 1 (originally done for lab 2, part 1, it was a single page with a review of something) as your starting point. 

1. Create a external CSS file with rules that:
   - Set a background image.
   - Set a fixed width for the body of the page.
   - Use the float property to move the figure to the right side of the page
   - Use the clear property to end the float.


### Part 2

Use lab 4, part 2 as a starting point. (Originally done for lab 2, part 2. It was a review site with a home page and at least three review pages.)

1. Use float and other appropriate CSS properties to create navigation buttons on each page.
2. On  at least one figure:
   - Add padding, a visible border, and margin.
   - Make the corners of the figure rounded.
   - Use relative positioning to place the figure somewhere other than its original location.
3. For the header of each page (including the home page):
   - Add a background image.
   - Set the Z order so that the heading (H1) is on top.

Check your pages using the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org)  and the [W3C CSS Validator](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).



## Submission

#### Publishing to citstudent

- Use FileZilla to upload the folders containing your web site to citstudent.
  - Do not zip the files.
  - If both parts 1 and 2 are in the same web site, you can just upload that one web site.
- Record the URL (web address) or your home page so that you can enter it on Moodle. 

#### Submitting to Moodle

- Zip the files in part 1

- Zip the files in part 2

- Upload both zip files to Moodle.
(If your part 2 contains the page in part 1, then you only need to zip and upload part 2)
  
- Enter the URL (web address) of your site in the "Online Text" box for this Moodle assignment.
(Without this, I won't be able to find your web page.)
