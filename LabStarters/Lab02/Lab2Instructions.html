    <h1>Lab 2 &mdash; Basic HTML Pages
        <br>CIS 195 Web Authoring 1</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    You will be creating the web pages described in Tutorial 1 of our textbook, <em>New Perspective on HTML, CSS and Dynamic
HTML</em>. For best the best learning experience, do your best to understand the concepts explained in the tutorial before writing your HTML code. You might want to read a few pages and then try writing some code, read a few pages, then write some more
    code.
    <br><br> Starting files for this lab are in the tutorial.01.zip file on Moodle.
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Tutorial 1: Create the J-Prop Shop web page described in the tutorial.
            <blockquote>Challenge: Make the web page by just looking at the picture on page 17 and then trying to write HTML that makes a web page which looks just like the picture. If you run into difficulty, then look at the step by step instructions. In “real
                life” you would do it this way-- you wouldn’t have step by step instructions.</blockquote>
        </li>

        <li>Review: Create the Basic Stick web page. Again, see if you can just look at the picture on page 61 and write HTML code to make a web page that looks just like the picture.</li>
        <li>Case Problem: Do any one of the case problems 1 - 3 on pages 63 – 69 in the Tutorial 1 chapter of the textbook.</li>
    </ol>
