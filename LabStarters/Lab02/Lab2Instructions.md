**CIS 195, Web Authoring**

# Lab 2 Instructions



## Part 1: Practice with elements

Create a single web page that presents a review of a book, movie, or music album of your choice and that uses what you learned last week as well as each of the following at least once:

- The `<blockquote>` element.
- The `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` elements.
- Special characters like &hearts;.
- A nested list.
- A horizontal rule.
- Comments.

Check your page using the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org)  



## Part 2: A multipage web site

Create a review site that contains <u>a home page</u> and at <u>least three review pages</u>.
 (You can use the page from Part 1 as one of the three review pages.)

- The home page will have links to the three review pages.
- All the review page files will be in a sub-folder named *reviews*.
- Each review page should have at least one figure on it.
  (They don't all need the additional elements required for the page in Part 1)
-  All the images should be in a sub-folder named *images*.

Check your pages using the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org)  



## Submitting your web sites to Moodle

- Zip the files in part 2 (part 2 includes your page from part 1)

- Upload the zip file to Moodle using the Lab 2 Submission link.
