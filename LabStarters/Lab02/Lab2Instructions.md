# Lab 2 Instructions

For this lab assignment, you will make a web site with reviews of anything you are interested in like books, movies, or music. In part 1, you will make a single web page containing a single review. In part 2 you will add a home page and two more review pages to make a complete review web site.

## Part 1: A Single Review Page

### Learning Objective

The objective of this part of the lab is to give you practice using basic HTML elements.

### Requirements

Create a single web page that presents a review of something of your choice and that uses each of the following HTML elements:

- A`<blockquote>` element.
- A`<figure>` and `<figcaption>` elements.
- One or more special characters like &hearts;.
- A nested list.
- A horizontal rule.
- Two or more comments. For one of the comments, put your name  and the date in the head element.

Check your page using the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org)  



## Part 2: A Review Web Site

### Learning Objective

The objective of this part is to learn to work with multiple pages and to manage sub-folders and file paths.

### Requirements

Create a review site that contains <u>a home page</u> and at <u>least three review pages</u>.
 (You will use the page from Part 1 as one of the three review pages.)

- The home page will have links to the three review pages.
- All the review page files will be in a sub-folder named *reviews*.
- Each review page should have at least one figure on it.
  (They don't all need the additional elements required for the page in Part 1)
-  All the images should be in a sub-folder named *images*.
-  Put your name as author of the web site and the date in a comment in the head element of each page.

Check your pages using the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org)  



## Submitting your web sites to Moodle
