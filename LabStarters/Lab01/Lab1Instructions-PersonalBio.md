# Instructions for Lab 1

# A Biographical Web Site

## Objectives

**Gain experience using:**

- Headings (h1, h2, etc.)
- Links (both between your pages and to an external site)

- Text formatting (strong, em, etc.)

- Images (don't forget the alt attribute)

- Line breaks

- Ordered lists

- Unordered lists

## Requirements

Create a web site that consists of at least <u>two web pages</u> and presents a mini biography of yourself or another person. <u>Use each of the HTML features listed above</u>. Be creative, organize the page as you like and include whatever content you wish. In addition:

- Include all the HTML elements that you need to put at the top of your web page (`<!DOCTYPE html>` and all the stuff that goes in the `head` element.) Don't forget the `html`, `head`, and `body` elements.
- Add a comment with your name and date in the head element.
- Indent your code to reflect the structure of the HTML elements.
- Name your home page *index.html*.
- In link and image elements, use just the file name, <u>not the path</u>. For example:
  `<a href="childhood.html">My childhood</a>`
  `<img src="myKitten.jpg">`
- Don't put spaces in folder or file names, just use letters, numbers, underscores, or dashes.
- Put the images in the same folder with your two web pages.

 

## Software you will use to create your web pages

To create your web pages, you can use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com ), which runs on Windows, Mac OS, or Linux. Alternatively, on Windows, you can use [Notepad++]( http://notepad-plus-plus.org ) or on Mac OS, [Text Wrangler]( http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler ).

 

## Submitting your web site

1. Zip the folder containing your html files and image files.
2. Upload the zip file using the link for Lab 1 on Moodle.
