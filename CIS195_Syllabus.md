## Course Description

This four-credit course provides students who have minimal computer experience with the concepts and skills necessary to create static web pages using HyperText Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).  Through hands-on practice students will master the concepts, tools and skills needed to construct web pages and to upload pages to a web server on the internet.

The intention of the course is to enable you to create and maintain static pages that could be part of any modern web site using current technologies and tools.

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Code Editors - for creating HTML and CSS files (like Visual Studio Code)
- FTP clients - for uploading files to a server (like FileZilla)

### Effort

Since this is a four-credit class, students will need to devote at least 12 hours per week to the class.

- 4 hours for class participation.
- 2 hours for reading (lecture notes and tutorials).
- 6 hours for lab assignments.

### Themes

In addition to the topics listed in the [course schedule](#course-schedule), these themes will be interwoven with those topics:

- How the Internet works (HTTP Protocol)
- Web page loading speed (performance)
- Browser compatibility
- Ethics and internet privacy
- Internet security

### Skills

- Explain the development of HTML and demonstrate understanding of web page tags, anatomy, formatting as well as use of logical and physical tags.

- Effectively use: structural elements, anchor tags, relative and absolute links, e-mail links, tables, colors, horizontal rules, image tags, background images, image hyperlinks, forms and form tags, form elements and element groups, custom buttons.

- Use cascading style sheet technology (CSS) to configure common page and text properties as well as for positioning of elements on a web page.

- Use an html validator and a CSS validator to ensure the correctness of web pages.

- Use an FTP client to upload and manage files on a web server.

- Discuss concepts, themes and issues orally and in writing.

- Evaluate your own web site implementation work.  Evaluate the web site implementation work of other students and provide constructive feedback orally and in writing.

- Respond appropriately to and assimilate feedback provided by other students and your instructor.

  

## Learning Resources

### Textbook

There is no textbook for this class. You will learn from the class lectures, lecture notes, and online tutorials. 

### Computer Lab and In-Person Tutoring

The CIT computer lab in building19, room 135, is equipped with computers and and all the software required for this course.  The lab is available to all students in the CIT department. There are tutors available in the lab to help you with your lab assignments. A schedule will be posted on the large white board inside the lab with a list of the tutors and the times they will be available.

### Online Tutoring and Support Services

In addition to the tutors available in the CIT computer lab, there is tutoring available online. You can connect with tutors, get technical support from the Student Help Desk (SHeD), and learn more about Career Pathways/STEP programs in the [Lane Support Hub](http://lanecc.edu/hub) (Zoom link: lanecc.edu/hub). Feel free to drop in or guarantee time with a tutor by making an appointment using [WCOnline](https://lanecc.mywconline.com/). Check out the [ATS website](https://www.lanecc.edu/get-support/academic-support/academic-and-tutoring-services) (link: lanecc.edu/tutor) for updated hours and additional information.

### Software

If you plan to do lab work somewhere other than in the classroom or the CIT Computer Lab, you will need: 

- "Office" software for Word processing, spreadsheets, slides, etc., such as [MS Office](https://lanecc.helpjuice.com/student-faqs/microsoft-office-365-for-lcc-students-staff), [LibreOffice](http://www.libreoffice.org) or [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com).

- A code (text) editor to create your web pages.  [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is a free code editor that can be downloaded via the internet and used on Windows, Mac OS or Linux. Alternatively, you can use TextWrangler on Mac OS, or Notepad++ on Windows.

- Software that can be used to manipulate images such as the <u>Windows Paint</u> program (included in Windows). Mac users can use the <u>Preview</u> app (included in MacOS), but it just barely meets the needs of this class. 

  Most other full-featured image editing apps such as Adobe Photoshop (not free), or [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) (a free, cross-platform, clone of Photoshop) will also meet the needs of this class. The two main things you'll need to do are: change the size of images and find pixel coordinates in images.

- At least two modern browsers to view/test your web pages.  The latest versions of [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), and [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) can be downloaded for free.  Many other browsers like Safari and Edge, are also suitable for your use in this class.

- An ftp client to upload your web pages to citstudent.lanecc.edu. [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?show_all=1) is a good free option that runs on Windows, Mac OS, or Linux.

### Web Resources

- http://classes.lanecc.edu (Moodle) is the Learning Management System for this course.  All course materials and activities will be managed through Moodle.
- http://citstudent.lanecc.edu will be used to host student web sites. You will be provided with the login information you need to upload your pages to this server.

## Assessment and Grading

Specific grading criteria will be applied to each of the labs, quizzes, and exams you will be working on in this class. Part of the lab involves a code review. Attendance is not graded.

| Assessment Activities                     | Percentage of grade |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Labs 1-8, 50 points each:                 | 40%                 |
| Quizzes 1-8,  10 points each              | 8%                  |
| Midterm and Final Exams,  125 points each | 25%                 |
| Project, 270 points                       | 27%                 |


Letter grades for the course will be determined by the following percentages:              

|      | -        |       | +      |
| ---- | -------- | ----- | ------ |
| A    | 90–91    | 92–97 | 98–100 |
| B    | 80–81    | 82–87 | 88–89  |
| C    | 70–71    | 72–77 | 78–79  |
| D    | 60–61    | 62–67 | 68–69  |
| F    | Below 60 |       |        |

### Late Work

- Lab Assignments:
  -  Lab assignments 1–4 must be submitted before the midterm.
  - Lab assignments 4–8 must be submitted before the final.
  - The grade for assignments submitted after the due date will be reduced by 10%. 
- Quizzes and exams cannot be taken after the due date except in emergency situations.

Exceptions will only be made for serious illness or emergency situations. 



### Weekly Learning Cycle

| Tuesday              | Wednesday      | Thursday                                                     | Friday        | Saturday | Sunday      |
| -------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| Participate in class | Start lab work | Participate in class <br /><br />Submit last week's lab assignment | Take the quiz |          | Quiz closes |



### Academic Honesty

While students are encouraged to discuss labs and to use each other as resources, each student is responsible for his/her own work. In other words, you can help each other, but you can't copy any part of someone else's work. The end product must be each student's own individual work.

### Attendance

Attendance is not a part of your grade, but it is essential that you log into Moodle at the beginning of every week to read the objectives for the week. Throughout the week, you will need to participate in live class sessions online or watch recordings of the lectures, and do the learning activities. 

**No-Show Drop:** LCC has a [no-show drop](https://www.lanecc.edu/esfs/noshow-drops) policy. which means that during the first week of the term, to avoid being dropped, a student must:

- Attend at least one online live class session 

  or

- Complete one quiz or assignment (for online classes)
