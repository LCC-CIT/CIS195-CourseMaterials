### Academic Honesty

While students are encouraged to discuss labs and to use each other as resources, each student is responsible for his/her own work. In other words, you can help each other, but you can't copy any part of someone else's work. The end product must be each student's own individual work.

### Attendance

**In-class sections:** attendance is not graded but will be essential for successful completion of the class. Students who miss a class are responsible for obtaining the course content provided in class and mastering it. 

**On-line sections:** it is essential that you log into Moodle at the beginning of every week to read the objectives for the week, watch the video lectures, and do the learning activities. 

**No-Show Drop:** LCC has a [no-show drop](https://www.lanecc.edu/esfs/noshow-drops) policy. which means that during the first week of the term, to avoid being dropped, a student must:

- Attend at least one class session (for on-campus class sections) 

  or

- Complete one quiz or assignment (for online classes)
