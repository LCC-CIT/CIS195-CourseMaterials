### Academic Honesty

While students are encouraged to discuss labs and to use each other as resources, each student is responsible for his/her own work. In other words, you can help each other, but you can't copy any part of someone else's work. The end product must be each student's own individual work.

### Attendance

Attendance is not a part of your grade, but it is essential that you log into Moodle at the beginning of every week to read the objectives for the week. Throughout the week, you will need to participate in live class sessions online or watch recordings of the lectures, and do the learning activities. 

**No-Show Drop:** LCC has a [no-show drop](https://www.lanecc.edu/esfs/noshow-drops) policy. which means that during the first week of the term, to avoid being dropped, a student must:

- Attend at least one online live class session 

  or

- Complete one quiz or assignment (for online classes)
